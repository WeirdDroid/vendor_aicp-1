As users started having problems with WhatsApp initialisation...one user on XDA provided a solution that seems to work so far:

1st:
I disabled all permissions from WA before I started the initialization process. Only synchronisation with the contacts won't work.

2nd:
Set back all permissions for WA.

3rd:
To synchronize the contacts go to settings > accounts > WA > WA again > menu > delete account.

4th:
Go back to WA and sync your contacts. Now it should be show them.

This is not a bug in the ROM!
